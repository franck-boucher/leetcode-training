# leetcode-training

Here are my solutions for the leetcode training I do in my spare time.

For these exercises I made [simple-expect](https://github.com/franck-boucher/simple-expect), it is a simple function to help assert the results of my solutions, check it out !

## How to run

1. Clone the repo and install Deno
   https://deno.land/

2. Run a solution

```
cd ./some_exercice
deno run main.ts
```

3. Run all tests

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-run main.ts
```
